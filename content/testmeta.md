The first journal entry in Tokyo. Took you long enough. I was wondering myself when would this happen, too. Now it's here and you are finally writing one. Good.

It's been a long time since I last write a journal entry. I looked at my last entry, it was September last year. Also it was about WoW addiction. Man, how things have changed. How things have REALLLYYYY changed.

Should I be writing it all down? I mean ... I don't really want to. Okay. Just for the sake of update, and for my future self, I will write it down. So yeah, me from the future, these are what happened. I don't want to go into details. You probably know of it too. I'm just here to remind you of stuff.

She went away. That's like, the number one biggest thing that happened. I ... don't think I have gotten over that yet. I've been in Tokyo for a month now, so I think it's getting better bit by bit. But still, a lot of times, I still get reminded of her. The way she dresses, her hair, the closeness we felt, the things we share. Eh. I don't want to rant too much. You know the details.

Sometimes it gets quite bad though. Esp when I watch Kuzu no Honkai, and read Murakami. I just finished that anime yesterday. Maybe I give it a 7 or 8. I like the first 9ish episodes, where the anime feels very ... real, but the ending... I don't agree with it.

Murakami though. I finished Kafka and currently on Norwegian Wood. I ... it gets real, yes, and the book was good, but I can't really put a score on it. I don't know how to grade it. It was ... quite a book. Reading Norwegian Wood give me a surreal feeling, cuz I'm in Tokyo, I'm in that exact place the characters were in. I been to those place. Or I will be.

She left without a reason. I'm not sure I don't want to know anymore.

Still haunts some of my dreams.

I'm have been off of Mary Jane for more than a month now. Of course it's all fine, but sometimes I still wish I can get a joint somewhere in Tokyo.

Let's see, what are there to update further, hmm. Ah, mom finds out about me and Mary Jane. I should feel bad. But I don't. It did not bother me that much, and I can't put my fingers on exactly why. It feels more of an inconvenience to me. I'd rather not have her found out. Kind of annoying.

Is this what Mary Jane did to me? Me and my irresponsibility?

The real reason I wanted to write this journal entry was because I was in a bit of stress. Not anymore though, but I was, a few days ago. (But instead of writing, I made effort to get my website back up, which ... doesn't serve any purpose because this journal is supposed to be private).

Maybe I was a bit too harsh on myself, and put on too many studying goals. I wanted to master all N4 kanji in one week, I want to review all of Genki 1 asap, I want to be able to talk in perfect Japanese, etc ... that kind of stuff. It really tires me out, and broke me. Maybe I was not ready for such things.

Also I am in some kind of financial crisis. I blew too much money. Almost spent a thousand dollars for only less than a month. This is not good. I only brought 1k7 here. I have to control myself. So my natural reaction was, to withdraw from social activities stuff, and study more, also back to coding. Maybe I can do something for a little bit of money for all this free time??

I keep getting the feeling that I am wasting my time here in Tokyo, though. I mean. How many chances do I get to BE in Tokyo? And being a student, too. A student with not that much homework, to be precise. Damn man, now I really feel like wasting time. Slow down a bit, ok? Chill. We will come up with something that doesnt compromise money but still ensures a great time in Tokyo. Somehow.

12:43 AM of the next day

Alright. Just got back from an izakaya. let's continue our journal. tmr is the only day off of Golden Week we have, so today is quite chill. Anyway,

I wanted to note down this thing of how I was really craving ... women. It may sounds a bit ... sinister ... but ... yes. I'm not sure what I am craving for is a relationship or just sex. I miss both of them. But for one thing, I am still this super shy of a dude to even initiate anything between any girls. And the second thing, ... I don't even speak the language that well. And the third thing, and probably the most disturbing ... she still haunts me, every now and then. Japanese people just .... reminds me of her a LOT. A WHOLE LOT. I feel like I could go crazy sometimes.

Why she has to look like Japanese that much. From hairstyles to make up to fashion. Her eyes, her facial features, everthing.

I might as well go mad.
