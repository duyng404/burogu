My name is <span class="bluetext">Duy Nguyen</span>. You can call me <span class="bluetext">Ferb</span>.

I'm studying Computer Science at Gustavus Adolphus College. I usually do mysterious computer stuff in my free time (mostly video games, but other stuff too, boring stuff).

I am also a wannabe H4xx0R, a Blizzard fanboy, and a Vocaloid maniac.

This is my personal website where I would put my cool projects. IF I HAD ANY.

Anyway you can contact me at dnguyen4 (at) gustavus (dot) edu. Send me memes. Thanks.

Anyway check me out on social media (or nah, I post weird stuff)
